**Today's Progress**: studied the basics of arrays and pointers.

**Thoughts:** Today was really demotivating...when i realised i couldnt take space separated inputs into an array.it feels like a de ja vu coz i faced this befre whne i learnt c coding. anyways like always i didnt give up and kept trying every single way i could .and i finally gave up and went to python to code my logic ,felt bad so i took help from my friend and finally got to know that its the easiest thing on c++...feels bad but i am happy !!! coz i finally started my coding ..and feels like i am getting back to track!!
So coming to point ,I did array rotation problem in c++ and python as well.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
