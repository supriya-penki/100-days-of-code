+# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2021 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: studied the basics of arrays and pointers.

**Thoughts:** Today was really demotivating...when i realised i couldnt take space separated inputs into an array.it feels like a de ja vu coz i faced this befre whne i learnt c coding. anyways like always i didnt give up and kept trying every single way i could .and i finally gave up and went to python to code my logic ,felt bad so i took help from my friend and finally got to know that its the easiest thing on c++...feels bad but i am happy !!! coz i finally started my coding ..and feels like i am getting back to track!!
So coming to point ,I did array rotation problem in c++ and python as well.

### Day 2: April 4,2021 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: learnt array functions
**Thoughts**: so today i focused on the requirements for online test for amazon.Coz i think that it will motivate me more and give a direction to my coding...like a more specific prep.I did 2 problems from a corse for amazon sde prep.

### Day 3: April 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: learnt about frequently used algorithms in STL

**Thoughts** I had to take a break coz last 10 days were my last days in college and i had to enjoy to the fullest.Anyways i enjoyed a lot and then i was busy in packing ..so i had to stop coding for few days...hmmm..i know its bad..but i had to!!.Okay after the break it was difficult to get back to the flow .I am still practising the course for amazon OT suggested by my friend. i sat for more than 0 hours not continuosly though,on 3 codes and i could successfully execute only one!!!....its sad ..but i got to know  a  lot of stuff..i dont know whether this hourney will benefit me or not...but i dont stop this...i even stopped posting on twitter i know irs bad coz my hr is seeing it.....noooo.but what can i do?????...its okay ..probably he wont even remember me...hahaa...okay lets get to the point..i successfully implemented max sum of rotating array.. and below is the link..

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 2: Feb 14, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem for linked list - easy.
**Thoughts** Took a long break but i wanna finish this !!, it was a easy question but again i complicated it! anyways got a shorter version from the internet and it was fast and satifying. **Note for myself: Take the bolded instructions seriously!! your hack to to solve the problem is hidden in those specific instructions!!!**

### Day 3: Feb 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem for linked list - easy  - Middle of the Linked List.
**Thoughts**  It was a easy question but again i complicated it! anyways got a shorter version from the from the discussion section. Tells the importance of two pointer approach !! and the bound checks I was abl ot correctly think what checks to put for the while loop!! it was good, usually i dont feel confident on how i think to put the bound checcks for the loop,but thisgave eme confidence. 

also solved : letcode meddium problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/submissions/1919979802/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=linked-list
umm wasted a lot of time because i knew i had to start at -1, but i have never done that in linkeddlist, so learnt that we can just initliaze a dummy node pointing to the head form where the pointers start!! and then start going ahead.
Good problem!
Again 2 pointer problem, makes you really think to how to play around with pointers and bit of math!!--**REDO**!!
**Note for myself:  The bound checks are important, take time and think it through, dont be lazy and silently just pray for it to work!!!**

### Day 4: Feb 16, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem for linked list - easy - reverse a linked list.
**Thoughts** Got the logic in the first go using a 3 pointer...but again!!! i wanst carefull about null pointer dereferncing!!!! be very careful with null pointers. place checks every where and see and also again inmissed the corener case of checking for just 1 element!!1 why???!!!
**Note for myself: Dont be lazy!!!, check the damn corener case !!! just plugin one and see what happens on a dry run without using the testcase. Most of my submissions fail at that case!! its very bad!!! so just do one dry run!! thats all!! dont be lazy takes literally 2mins and helps you improve doing code walk through!! okay?**


### Day 5: Feb 17, tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem for linked list - medium - rotate a linked list by k.
**Thoughts** found the logic myself and it works in O(2*n) time!!but again could pass all the testcases in first go. this time i did check the corner case first but again missed out on another corner = case. Its okay I am gettign there. I need to slowly build thinking about all the corner cases. No one starts a pro, and dtis is how i will build thinking the corner cases, no one is born with the ability to just think all the test cases. Poeple build it over time and i am going to have patience and do it and be consistent.
**Note for myself:Its okay if it takes time, practise, and dlearn by you maded certain mistakes, rather giving it dorectly to chatgpt tp find the mistake, try to think about it by yourself, even if this takes time to do it , you will learn faster!!!**
